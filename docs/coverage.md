# Agentic coverage harness

`rupu coverage` turns "review this repo for X" from an unauditable one-shot into
a **persistent, accumulating, comparable record** of what an agent examined, for
which criteria, and what it concluded.

## At a glance

When a model performs a survey task — "review this repo for vulnerabilities",
"find every place we touch the database", "audit for accessibility" — findings
vary run-to-run, and you can't tell *"no issues found"* apart from *"the model
never looked."* The coverage harness fixes that:

- **Coverage is explicit.** For every `(file × concern)` the agent assesses, it
  records a verdict — `clean` / `finding` / `examined` / `not_applicable` — with
  evidence. File reads/greps/edits are tracked automatically.
- **Runs accumulate.** A second pass (same model or a different one) picks up
  where the first left off; cross-model verdicts are attributed and merge-able.
- **Industry-anchored catalogs.** Ship OWASP Top 10, CWE Top 25, the full CWE
  weakness list, STRIDE, secrets, and more; include or extend them.
- **Surface-uniform.** Works the same whether the agent loop is driven by
  `rupu run`, a workflow, an autoflow cycle, or an interactive session.

On top of that foundation, the harness also lets you **measure and reproduce**
variance: diff two runs, and replay a run to compare it against the original.

## How it works

Coverage data for a *target* lives under `<workspace>/.rupu/coverage/<target_id>/`
as append-only JSONL plus a catalog snapshot:

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `files.jsonl` | every file touch (read / grep / glob / edit / cmd), with attribution |
| `concerns.jsonl` | every `(concern, file) → verdict` assertion |
| `findings.jsonl` | every reported issue |
| `catalog.yaml` | the effective concern catalog, snapshotted at run start |
| `runs.jsonl` | one manifest per run (its defining inputs, for replay) |

`<target_id>` is derived deterministically from `(workspace, scope_name)`, so the
same agent against the same repo accumulates into one target across runs, while
different workspaces stay distinct. Every row carries `run_id` + `model` +
`surface` attribution, which is what makes cross-run and cross-model analysis
possible.

## Turning it on: the `concerns:` block

An agent activates the harness by declaring a `concerns:` block in its
frontmatter. The block is a list of catalog includes (with optional overrides,
filters, and render mode). When present, the runtime flattens the catalog,
snapshots it, injects the catalog into the system prompt, and registers the
coverage tools.

```yaml
---
name: security-assessor
permissionMode: readonly
concerns:
  - include: owasp-top10-2021
    mode: full
  - include: cwe-top25-2023
    mode: full
  - include: secrets-in-source
    mode: full
  - include: stride
    mode: full
  - include: cwe-software-development   # ~399 CWEs
    mode: index                          # one-line table, searched on demand
---
You are a security assessor. For each (file × concern) you assess, call
coverage_mark; for each issue, call report_finding…
```

**Render modes.** `full` inlines each concern's body into the prompt; `index`
renders a compact one-line-per-concern table that the agent searches on demand
(use it for large catalogs like the full CWE list so the prompt stays small);
`auto` (default) picks based on catalog size.

### Bundled catalogs

`rupu coverage templates list` prints them all:

```
owasp-top10-2021        owasp-api-top10-2023
cwe-top25-2023          cwe-software-development   cwe-research
stride                  secrets-in-source          code-smells
web-security-default    api-security-default
```

User catalogs may live in `.rupu/concerns/` (project) or `~/.rupu/concerns/`
(global) and are discovered by name; project overrides global overrides builtin.

### Coverage tools the agent gets

When `concerns:` is set, these tools are injected automatically (you do **not**
list them in the agent's `tools:`):

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `coverage_mark` | record a `(concern, file)` verdict + evidence |
| `report_finding` | record an issue (severity, location, remediation) |
| `coverage_remaining` | list in-scope files still lacking an assertion |
| `coverage_status` | summary of assessed-vs-gap progress |
| `coverage_concerns_search` / `coverage_concerns_detail` | search / fetch full bodies for index-mode catalogs |

## CLI

All inspection commands take the global `--format table|json|csv` flag
(`table` is the default; structured commands support `table`/`json`, tabular
ones also `csv`).

```
rupu coverage list                          List targets under .rupu/coverage/
rupu coverage templates {list, show}        List bundled catalogs / print one's concerns
rupu coverage catalog <target>              Print the effective catalog snapshot
rupu coverage show <target>                 Derived view: files touched + assertions + findings
rupu coverage audit <target>                Full report: per-concern coverage, gaps, cross-model, serendipitous findings
rupu coverage gap <target>                  Just the gaps (in-scope files lacking an assertion)
rupu coverage runs <target>                 List the runs recorded against a target
rupu coverage diff <target> [base compare]  What changed between two runs (defaults: previous latest)
rupu coverage rerun <target> <run_id>       Replay an agent run, appending a new run to the same target
```

Find a target id with `rupu coverage list`, then inspect:

```bash
rupu coverage audit a1b2c3d4e5f6          # human report
rupu --format json coverage audit a1b2c3d4e5f6   # machine-readable
rupu --format csv  coverage runs  a1b2c3d4e5f6
```

## The rerun → diff loop

Model output varies run-to-run — sometimes usefully (different angles surface
different bugs), but you could never evaluate *the combination* for
completeness. Now you can:

```bash
rupu run security-assessor "assess this repo"   # run 1
rupu coverage runs <target>                      # grab run 1's id
rupu coverage rerun <target> <run_id>            # replay it → run 2, same target
rupu coverage diff <target> <run_id> latest      # what did run 2 do differently?
```

`diff` reports four dimensions: **cell-coverage delta** (newly / no-longer
asserted), **verdict flips** (with `clean → finding` flagged), **findings
appeared / disappeared**, and **file-touch delta**.

> v1 `rerun` dispatch covers the **agent** surface; session / workflow / autoflow
> runs are captured but `rerun` returns an explicit "not yet supported" error.
> A replay re-resolves provider/model/concerns from the agent's current
> frontmatter (it goes through `rupu run`), so those manifest fields are a record
> of the original run, not replay inputs.

## Determinism

Everything the harness controls about what the model sees — concern ordering,
the catalog snapshot, and the live file list — is byte-stable and independent of
the order catalog inputs are declared in. That makes the model the *only* source
of run-to-run variance, which is exactly what `diff` measures. The harness does
**not** claim byte-identical model output: prompt *construction* is
deterministic; sampling is not.
